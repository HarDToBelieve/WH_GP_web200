The bánh family includes a number of steamed rice cake-like dishes. So soft and delicate, my favorite was this bánh cuốn straight from the steamer. Our Intrepid Travel guide took us to a third-generation bánh cuốn master in Hanoi who mesmerized us with her skills. She ladled each scoop of the rice flour-based batter onto the steamer, covering it with a lid for a matter of seconds, then carefully transferred the gossamer-thin sheets with a bamboo stick onto a tray to be filled with minced mushrooms and pork. Each bite is topped with deep-fried shallot bits and must be dipped into that nước chấm sauce.

<b>Also in the "bánh" family</b>: bánh bèo (literally "water fern cake") from the old imperial city of Hue in central Vietnam. It's topped with chopped shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots, and fish sauce.
