From what I've been told, banh cam and banh ran are nearly identical to one another, minus some nuanced regional differences. Crisp on the outside and chewy inside, these golden-fried glutinous balls are speckled with sesame seeds and filled with a sweet mung bean paste. One of the most beloved Vietnamese desserts and for obvious reason. I mean, they are deep-fried balls of sweet mung bean-filled joy.
