This is not something you'll find all over Vietnam—it's very unique to Hoi An, the historic trading port town along the central coast. The most important element of this pork and noodle dish is the noodles. They're made with water drawn from one specific well: the thousand-year-old Ba Le well in Hoi An. (What if they were made with water from a different well?! Let's not even entertain that thought.) The noodles are pre-soaked in the magical well water along with lye made from wood ash brought from the Cham Islands outside of Hoi An—told you these were special noodles! They end up having a special chewiness and are served in some, but not much, broth with thinly sliced pork, herbs, bean sprouts, and crisp crouton-like squares of fried dough.
